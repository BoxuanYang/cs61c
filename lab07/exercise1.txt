Scenario 1
    1. Because the blocksize in bytes is exactly equal to step size in byte.
    2. 0.0
    3. Step size, 1. 

Scenario 2
    1. 16. (256/4 = 64 words, 64/2 = 32 times, 32/ 2 = 16 misses)
    2. MHHH. 
    3. 1.0

Scenario 3
    1.
    2.

Checkoff Question 1: 
Because the block size is exacly equal to step size in bytes and the 
associativity is 1. Each time we increment the step, we overwrite the index-0
block at the cache with the new element. Hence we will never have a hit.

Checkoff Question 2:
Step size and block size.

Checkoff Question 3:
Read first, miss, then write, hit, next, H, next write: hit


Checkoff Question 4:
Once we finish the first iteration, the whole array is copied to the cache.
From now on, there will be no more misses, i.e., the total hits = 16. So hit 
rate approaches 0 as rep count goes to infinity.

Checkoff Question 5:
In this scenario, we should try to modify the program such that during each
iteration, we apply all the mapping functions to (blocksize / 4) number of 
elements.
