Checkoff Question 1:
Because for each inner loop, A[i][k] can be viewed as a constant and C[i] array 
and B[k] array has already been loaded into cache, resulting in high hit rate for
both B and C. 

Checkoff Question 2:
Because for each inner loop, B[k][j] can be viewed as a constant. If we iterate
i for C[i] and A[i], it would create low hit rate for both A and C.

Checkoff Question 3:
When we are writing programs, we should always think of how the cache would work
according to our program. Best performance always come when we maximize the local 
and temporal locality.
