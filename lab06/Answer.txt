Ex 1:

Key concepts:
 setup time: when the input must be stable before rising edge
 hold time: when the input must be stable after rising edge
      
Max clcok rate 
= minimum time for a single instruction
# CLK2Q delay should not be included
= 60(mul delay) + 45(add delay) + 10(setup time) 
= 115ns

max clock cycle = 1 / (115ns) = 8.6 * 10^6 Hz

Ex 2:
  Maximum clcok rate
= Minimum clock cycle

T1 = 60(mul) + 10(setup) = 70
T2 = 10(clk to q) + 45(add) + 10(setup) = 65

Minimum clock cycle = max(T1, T2) = 70

Hence, Max clock rate = 1/70ns = 14.29 * 10^6 Hz
